# Below is the syntax to write long text
long_text: >
  this is a 
  text that is 
  supposed to be long

# The above is equivalent to
# { "long_text": "this is a text that is supposed to be long\n" }

# To preserve the new lines do
long_text_2: |
  this is a text
  that will have a newline
  on each line

# The above is equivalent to
# { "long_text_2": "this is a text\nthat will have a newline\non each line\n" }
